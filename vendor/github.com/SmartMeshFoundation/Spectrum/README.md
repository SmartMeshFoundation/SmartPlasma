# Spectrum

Spectrum is an [Ethereum-compatible](https://github.com/SmartMeshFoundation/Spectrum) project. It uses a new consensus and new block reward for SmartMesh ecosystem devices and IOT.Â 

Since the list of signers is 17, it is recommended that the confirmation number of general transfer transaction block be set to 17 (one round), and that of exchange block be set to 34 (two rounds).

## Build the source 

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/SmartMeshFoundation/Spectrum/wiki/Building-Specturm) on the wiki.

Building Spectrum requires both a Go (version 1.9.2 or later) and a C compiler. You can install them using your favourite package manager.

## Encrypt your nodekey

     $ ./build/bin/smc security --passwd
## Decrypt your nodekey

     $ ./build/bin/smc security --unlock
     
## Run fast node to test smc

    $ ./build/bin/smc console
    
## Create new account

    > personal.newAccount()

## View the miner nodes

* tribe.getStatus()
* then you will see the following message:
<pre><code>{
  "epoch": 5760,
  "number": 39601,

}</code></pre>

that tell you there are two miners in the testnet.

## View the block mining history in console

* tribe.getHistory(11,false)
    
* then you will see the following message (console format):
<pre><code>[{
    ðŸ”¨: "39708 -> 0x7B06dd132c089034157f1E1AAcda75787DF1e0c5"
}, {
    ðŸ”¨: "39707 -> 0xc22D53456ABd14Da347517a4B47ea24866B8E3Ae"
}, {
    ðŸ”¨: "39706 -> 0xAd4c80164065a3c33dD2014908c7563eFf88Ab49"
}, {
    ðŸ”¨: "39705 -> 0x3a5fBaC6CA913599C5fde8c1638dB58d01De8A48"
}, {
    ðŸ”¨: "39704 -> 0x00aB501f3Fe4b2f71651764699EC5752598E679f"
}]</code></pre>

that tell the block number and miner's account that generate that block.

## get your own miner account

    every node has it's own miner account, you can run getMiner() function to get that account:

    > tribe.getMiner() 

    then you will see below messages:
    {
        address: "0x00ab501f3fe4b2f71651764699ec5752598e679f",
        balance: 2001223531052513000,
        level: "Signer"
    }
    that will show your miner account and the balance of miner account in Wei unit.

## becoming a miner 

    if you want to become a miner, you will send 1 smt to the miner account, after this transfer,
    you will run miner.start() to join into the miners group.

    > miner.start()
